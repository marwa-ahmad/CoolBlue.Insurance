# Coolblue Software Development Assignment 
The work you will do as a part of this assignment is to implement the user stories specified below. It should give you a good understanding of what it is like to work with Coolblue, and it should give us a better understanding of your skills. So, good for you, and good for us! 

You have one whole week (including the weekend) to hand your solution back in but please plan your days to give yourself enough time for the assignment. It’s not a requirement to finish all stories at all costs but whatever you do manage to complete should be done to the standards we expect.

# Our technical values at Coolblue:
1. We value team communication so we document our design/architecture choices
2. We have a strong culture of Test Driven Development, before we write production code we prefer to write tests first
3. We like to know what our applications and services are doing in production without necessarily having to debug code or without needing the customer to tell us something is wrong so we proactively monitor them and invest in logging.
4. We value SOLID principles and are pragmatic around applying them to the systems we build
5. We ensure our applications and systems are self-healing and resilient in face of failures

# What we expect in your solution:
- Behavioural tests
- Appropriate separation of concerns
- A solution with an architecture that you can defend and would feel comfortable putting in production.
- Readable code with meaningful names for variables/classes/interfaces etc.
- Appropriate exception handling and fault tolerance
- Should be runnable on our machines so keep that in mind while picking third party tools and apps etc.
- Documentation of your design decisions and technical choices for the tasks. A simple markdown or text file (included in your submission) showing the following will be enough: 
   - **Assumption/Decision Made**
   - **Reason**
   
# Your colleagues
We are, of course, not going to let you deal with the assignment on your own. You will have two software developers available via email if you have any questions and their contact details are below. We will respond within 4 working hours, at the most. Please make sure you send us your questions before/after the weekend, as we don’t work on the weekends.
